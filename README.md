asciidoctor-extension-reverse-chapter

It switches th position of numbering and chapter/table/figure prefixes (so that they are basically postfixes then),
This is helpfull for languages where `Chapter 1` is invalid but `1. Chapter` is the only valid thing.

This asciidoctor extension is based on the post in:
https://asciidoctor.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/288690-users.2Fasciidoctor-pdf/topic/Change.20order.20of.20Chapter.2FSection.20numbering
Which was authored by r0ckarong and then got extended by DEvil0000 to match the exact needs.
Thanks r0ckarong for your help.
